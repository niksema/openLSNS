The Large Scale Network Simulation software package (openLSNS) is designing
to develop and simulate the activity of large networks of synaptically-connected,
biophysically-relevant neurons. The openLSNS is suppose to be cross-platform
software package that should run under Windows/Linux operating systems and is
able to run simulation both on x86 and GPU-based architecture (CUDA).
